We help researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams as part of the broader global open movement.\nWe’re developing this tutorial to help folks of different technical skills use quarto for documentation and tutorial building. This tutorial was originally created for both NASA-Openscapes researcher support engineers and communications directors at organizations promoting open science. The structure follows a previous tutorial Making free websites with RStudio’s RMarkdown."
