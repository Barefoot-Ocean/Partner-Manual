    "text": "Updating reference files in Smartsheet\nAll reference files are updated in Smartsheet Dynamic View. Reference files serve as inputs for dropdown lists in KoboToolbox forms and contain data that is added to the master datasets through joins. They contain comprehensive information on the administrative levels of the fishing communities (country, province, district, village), landing sites, fishing ground, fishers, buyers, data collectors, species, management areas, gear types, and partnering organizations. The steps below outline how to update reference files with new information.\nStep 1: Create a free smartsheet account.\n\nA free account can be created at https://www.smartsheet.com/\nSelect \"Try smartsheet for free\"\n\nStep 2: Provide Barefoot Ocean the email address you used to create your smartsheet account.\n\nBarefoot Ocean will then share the reference files associated with your organization.\nTo view your reference files you will need to sign into smartsheet Dynamic View using your smartsheet credentials: https://dynamicview.smartsheet.com/login \nOnce logged in to Dynamic View (not the smartsheet app), you will see a list of reference files shared with your account (Figure 1).\n\nStep 3: Click on a reference file to make updates\n\nOnce open, you can click on each row to make edits to existing data, or click the \"New\" button in the top right corner to add new data (Figure 2). \nA details panel will appear on the right hand side where you'll input the necessary information (Figure 3; Table 1). Select \"save\" on the bottom right of the details panel when you are finished updating. You do not need to notify Barefoot Ocean when you make changes or additions to ref sheets. The will be automatically merged with the master reference files and incorporated in Kobo.\nTo leave a comment or to ask the Barefoot team any questions, select the \"Comments\" tab in the details panel. All individuals that the reference file is shared with, including the Barefoot Ocean team, will receive notification when a comment is made, so there is no need to tag any particular individual.\n\nStep 4: Respond to update requests when data is missing or incorrect, or to respond to a comment.\n\nIf there is incomplete or incorrect information that is essential for populating Kobo dropdowns or for joins, or if a comment is made in the sheet, an update request will be sent to all appropriate users, prompting them to update the information or respond to a comment (Figure 4). By default, everyone with access to your reference files will receive the update request..\nA preview of the data that needs to be updated or responded to will appear below the email message, but you will not be able to update any data directly in the email\n\nAt the bottom of the email, there is a link for \"Go to the sheet\"; however, the underlying sheet has restricted access. Please review your data or respond to the comment via Open request.\n\nClick on the \"Open Request\" button in the email message.\nA new internet browser window will open with a form-like setup for each entry (Figure 5)\nReview the BFO fields and populate the editable fields. \nClick next at the bottom of the screen to move through each entry that needs to be updated.\nTo skip an entry (e.g. if you are not sure yet which answer to pick) click \"Next\" without making a selection in the editable columns. The next entry that needs to be updated will appear.\nIf you need to exit the page or stop before all entries have been updated, your choices should be saved the next time you reopen the request. Upon opening to continue, just click \"Next\" until you find an entry that needs to be updated.\nWhen you get to the last entry, click \"Done\". A pop-up message will appear asking if you are 'Ready to submit your update?':\n\nClick \"Go Back\" if you need to review \nClick \"Submit Update\" to submit your updates.\nYour updates are automatically appended to the reference file and you can view them in Dynamic View\n\n\nIf at any time you encounter any errors, have questions, or need support for updating reference files, please contact us at barefootinfo@barefootocean.org.",

Repeating the Community Profiling Survey can help document significant changes occurring over time.\n\n\nMethodology\nInformation can be gathered through third-party surveys (i.e, census, fisheries department records, etc), focus groups consisting of 10-20 key community members or key informants. Community leaders as well as a variety of knowledgeable and diverse fishers and fish traders (including women and young people) would be the ideal participants to include in the focus group. In facilitating the focus groups, it is recommended to have, at a minimum, a facilitator and a note-taker. At the focus group, it is also recommended to have participants provide a list of/contact information for fishers in the community who can then be contacted to administer the Household Surveys.If it is not possible to carry out the Community Profiling Survey in a focus group format, an alternative is to administer the same questions as individual surveys with key informants and pool the responses. Questions included in the community profiling survey and recommendations for conducting focus group discussions can be found here). \n\n\nLandings Monitoring Survey\n\n\nGoal\nCapture key data needed to calculate simple length-based indicators of fishery health and to track changes in fisheries production, value, and composition.\n\n\nData Collected\n\nDate landed\nLanding location\nFish trader name\nFisher name\nFishing Effort (days fishing/gleaning)\nSpecies identity (local, common, scientific names)\nTotal count\nTotal weight\nTotal price\nReason total catch not sold, if applicable\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\nFishers as they land their catch or at a fish buyers’ house/market.\n\n\nFrequency and Timing\nThe Landings Monitoring Survey should be conducted daily or as often as possible. \nPerform Landings Monitoring Surveys before and after implementation to evaluate the effects of fisheries closures or other management strategies. \nWe recommend collecting data 30 days before and after temporary closure periods. For the first seven days of the sampling periods, we recommend that enumerators conduct Landings Monitoring Surveys daily. If possible, continue daily monitoring for the entire 30-day period. If this is not possible, survey at least 80% of days within each 30 days. We also recommend surveying 80% or more of all fishers landing catch on a particular day pre or post-closure. Distribute representative survey efforts between boat fishers and non-boat fishers. Collect data from all fishers landing in the village, regardless of whether or not they were fishing within the closure site.  \nFor longer-term closures, ensure that data is collected during the same month for each year to capture change over the closure period. If that is not feasible, we recommend gathering data during the same month before and after the closure. As stated above, we recommend surveying at least 80% of the day within the month and 80% of fishers landing catch on each day. \n\n\nMethodology\nUsing the Kobo form, meet fishers at landing sites/buyers’ houses to record their catch.",

    "text": "Data Flow Overview\nBarefoot Ocean processes and analyzes key fisheries and socioeconomic data owned by partnering organizations through data sharing. In other words, partners own the data, and Barefoot Ocean processes it. Data collection, validation, transformation, and visualization are the four major components of the Barefoot Ocean data system. The primary software applications used are KoboToolBox, Smartsheet, PostgreSQL, and R. \nKoboToolBox is a free and open-source software that is a powerful toolkit for data collection accessible through challenging environments and multiple platforms, such as mobile devices, computers, and paper. Enumerators collect data on socioeconomic and ecological conditions essential to assess fishery communities and statuses through the Barefoot Ocean KoboToolBox survey questionnaires. Smartsheet is a collaborative work management platform that provides a flexible and intuitive interface for organizations to plan, track, automate, and manage various projects and processes in real-time. Reference files that are used to populate survey forms and connect additional data to the master datasets are managed in Smartsheet. Additionally, data is validated in Smartsheet. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source database management system used as a data warehouse for numerous web, analytics, and geospatial applications while storing unstructured and structured data in a single product. R is a free and open-source software environment and programming language widely used for data science, statistical computing, and data visualization. Data dashboards are built using the Shiny package from the R programming language and hosted on shinyapps.io, a platform as a service (PaaS) for hosting Shiny web apps (applications).\n\nFigure X: Barefoot Ocean Data Flow diagram.\nData collection involves systematically collecting and measuring information from relevant sources on variables of interest for decision-making, strategic planning, outcome evaluations, and other purposes. By incorporating quantitative and qualitative data in the survey questionnaires, Barefoot Ocean focuses on mixed-method surveys in the data collection process to develop a more in-depth understanding of the socioeconomic and ecological conditions pertinent to fishery communities and adaptive management strategies. Data validation refers to applying methods to measure the conditions of the collected data and determine whether the collected data meets the defined quality criteria, such as accuracy, consistency, relevancy, completeness, and uniqueness. Data transformation converts, cleans, and structures raw data into a usable format that can be analyzed and assessed for decision-making. Data analysis and visualization involves designing and creating accessible graphics or visual displays of information to effectively communicate the complex qualitative and quantitative data previously collected, verified, and transformed across target audiences. We have described the data flow process below:  \n\nData is collected through KoboToolBox survey forms. \nData is pulled into the Barefoot Ocean database. \nIf the enumerator selected pre-populated answer choices in surveys, the data does not need to be validated and can directly go through to the data analysis and visualization process.\nIf the enumerator manually enters data such as a new fisher, buyer, data collector, landing site, or species, the data is verified in Smartsheet before being included in the final data table and visualized in the dashboard. Field team leads are notified via email when data is ready for validation. Team leads will manually check the quality control tables to confirm that the newly added information is valid. \nAfter validation, new data is pushed to both the reference files and back to the database for final transformation before analysis and visualization.\nOnce data is pushed to the reference files, team leads will be notified via email if any additional information is needed in the reference files. \nUpdated reference files are then uploaded to the KoboToolBox platform for inclusion in the forms. \nUpdated data from the reference files are also used in the data transformation process to join additional data fields such as coordinates and gender. \nThe final steps of the data transformation process results in master data tables that are used for data analysis and visualization in the data dashboards. \nData dashboards (i.e. Shiny apps) connect directly to the database, pulling the most up-to-date data available, thereby providing partners near immediate access to raw and summarized data.",

Detailed instructions on setting up a Kobo account, collecting data, and submitting data can be found here. Use a QR code to configure all devices after manually setting up the first phone or tablet to set up multiple phones or tablets under one data collection account. Manual setup of the first device requires the Kobo server URL, username, and password. The Kobo server URL is https://kc.kobotoolbox.org. More information on setting up data collection with Kobo, including how to configure multiple data collection devices via a QR code, can be found here. \nOnce you have downloaded KoboCollect, open the app and enter the server URL, username, and password to connect your KoboCollect app to the KoboToolbox server. Connecting the KoboCollect app to the KoboToolbox server allows you to download deployed forms from KoboToolbox to your mobile device and send data collected through the app back to the server. On the home screen, select “Get Blank Form.” A list of all your deployed survey forms should appear. Press “Select All” to have all the survey forms sent to the app, or select the ones you wish to have by selecting them manually. Then click “Get Selected.” To deploy the survey, select “Fill Blank Form.”\nWhile the webform is automatically updated when a new survey version is available, users must configure “auto-update” themselves in the app. Regularly updating the surveys in the app ensures using the latest version of the form and not causing data pipeline issues down the line. You can set up auto-update in the app by going to “Settings” and “Form Management.” More information on automatically updating surveys in the app can be found here, under the section “Form Management Setting in KoboCollect.” It is important to note that a connection is required for the app to pull the most recent survey version, even with auto-update settings turned on. Therefore, advise enumerators to have an internet connection before performing field work so KoboCollect can pull the most recent version.\nAfter collecting data, the surveys submitted via the web form will be automatically submitted to the server once the data collector hits the “Submit” button. Data collected via the KoboCollect app is first saved in the app in a holding place and then pushed to the server. Completed surveys remain on hold before submitting to the server so that data collectors can make survey edits after collecting data, or if there is no internet connection, the app can save the surveys and then push the surveys to the server once there is internet connectivity. Specifically, when the survey is complete, the user will hit “Save form and exit,” ensuring that “Mark form as finalized” is also checked. “Edit Saved Form” automatically stores the saved form. The data collector can make necessary changes and select “Save Form and Exit.” The home screen also has a button called “Send Finalized Form.” Press Select All (or select the ones you wish to upload) and then press “Send Selected.” Select “View Sent Form” to ensure successfully uploading the forms and you should now be able to view all the submitted forms.\nA central data storage system links to the Kobo data, and automated analyses and visualizations will be available through a standardized dashboard. Raw data is backed up in the KoboToolbox database and will be available through download or direct link to another database or data warehouse.",

    "section": "Focus Group Discussion Guidance",
    "text": "Focus Group Discussion Guidance\nThe following contains guidance and recommendations on conducting a focus group to capture community profiling information. Holding a focus group session is recommended to encourage dialogue, capture a diversity of opinions, and begin building relationships with important community members. However, in the case that a focus group is not feasible, the community profiling survey can be conducted as individual interviews with important stakeholders using the “Community Profiling Survey” Kobo form. Overall, the goal of the community profiling exercise, whether in a focus group or individual interview format, is to understand the general landscape of the community and the fisheries operating within the community.\n\nPrior to conducting a focus group\nBefore hosting a formal fisheries profiling focus group, it is recommended to conduct informal conversations and participant observation. This method means spending time, building relationships, and understanding the fishery using informal conversation and participant observation.\nInformal conversation is important to better understand the general fisheries context before conducting a focus group discussion. Use this method as one of the starting points to formulate the content of the focus group discussion. This method will allow you to get to know the fisheries community, to start building relationships, and to gain trust.\nRecommended tips to conduct informal conversations:\n\nRespect cultural differences. Observe social norms such as acceptable greetings, dress codes, and respect religious practices. Be polite, humble, and listen to stakeholder opinions without imposing your own. Staying within a community, building a rapport, and sharing meals can help to build trust.\nSpend time with stakeholders. There is no shortcut to gaining trust and support. Especially within communities it is good to be seen, spend time in the villages and meet people. Be prepared to discuss the broader issues within the community. Do not try to push one particular agenda.\nUse the local language if possible, unless a common language is accessible. Otherwise, use an interpreter. Be mindful of errors in translation. Cross checking translation between more than one interpreter can help reduce misinterpretation.\nDo not make promises that cannot be kept. Be clear on objectives and expected outcomes without raising expectations. This is important to emphasize early on so that communities have a clear understanding on the role of the technical partner, i.e. to facilitate the octopus fishery closure, not to dig wells or repair schools. It is important to ensure everyone is aware of what the organization can and cannot do within the community. Ensuring realistic expectations helps to minimize disappointment, complaints, and conflicts as the project progresses.\nCommunicate plans and activities widely. Ensure any meetings or activities are planned in advance and at mutually agreeable times and locations to maximize attendance. Ensure any changes in plans and activities are communicated as early as possible. Being on time and sticking to agreements helps to build trust and confidence between stakeholders.\nAlways acknowledge stakeholders in project outputs such as reports and media releases within stakeholder meetings and external presentations. Be aware of information ‘ownership’ and respect confidentiality and privacy.\n\nBetter understanding the stakeholder landscape in the community is a crucial goal in conducting informal conservations and participant observation. Stakeholders affect or can be affected by an organization’s actions. Their support is essential for an organization’s success in implementing fisheries management plans. By better understanding stakeholders, you will effectively identify stakeholders involved in future fisheries monitoring for fisheries management in their area.\nExamples of types of stakeholders to include:\n\nFishers\nHead of village\nFaith/religious leaders\nHead of district\nCommunity health worker/health practitioner\nVillage buyer/supplier\nProcessing plant\nWomen in the village/fishers’ wives\n\nInformation to be collected about stakeholders:\n\nInformation about key stakeholders and their positions in relation to an entity’s objectives (degree of support, power, etc.). This information can be used to identify which stakeholders to include in the community profiling focus group.\n\nAfter conducting informal conversations, the next step you can do is participant observation. Observation is a method that allows you to use the events around you to gather clues and generate conclusions about specific locales or experiences by observing a day in the fishing village. This method is necessary to gather evidence from the information provided in informal conversations. This method allows you to understand the fishing village’s daily life activities.\n\n\nFocus Group Procedures\n\nOrganizing the focus group\n\n\nIt is important to maintain good relationships with target communities. Therefore, wherever possible villages should be informed of the programme for the focus group meeting at least two weeks in advance.\nIf the village has mobile phone reception, call the head of the village or other local contact(s).\nIf the village does not have mobile phone reception, conduct a visit to the village to meet with the head of village or other local contact(s).\nDuring this phone call or visit with the village president or other local contact(s), explain the following:\n\nAim of the meeting\nLocation of the meeting\nDate and time of the meeting\nMethod of informing participants of the meeting\nNumber of participants\n\nAll villagers or special people based on best fishers (2)\nMost frequent fishers (2)\nFishers that frequent many different fishing sites (2)\nWell-respected fishers preferably with experience in mapping (2)\n\n\nWomen - check with the head of the village if the focus group can take place with both sexes present together in advance as in some areas, this is not always possible.\nTry to avoid conducting the meeting(s) during spring tides/high fishing season, as many of the required fishers will likely be busy fishing.\nBe sure to check schedules of other projects that might be working in the same area at the same time to avoid clashes.\n\n\nFocus group team\n\nThe following are the recommended roles for the team leading the focus group. At a minimum, a focus group should have a facilitator and a note-taker.\nLead facilitator: Leads and moderates the meeting\n\nIntroduces the meeting\nFacilitates the event\nModerates the process\nActs as a catalyst between the individuals of the group\nFinds ways of integrating dominant and quiet people and makes sure that all group members are able to express their opinions\nMakes sure that the group keeps to the topic but is also flexible in handling additional important information\nRepeats in own words what people say in order to confirm that there is a good understanding of the discussion\nTakes care of time management\n\nFacilitator Assistant: Assists the lead facilitator, especially in displaying visual aids\n\nSupports the note-taker in gathering all relevant information\nLeads the displaying of visual aids and assists with other interactive components of the meeting such as tallying votes, taking notes that are displayed, passing out materials, etc.\nBrings along the necessary material\nAssists the facilitator in an indirect way by giving signs (e.g., pointing out those who wish to speak). \nSupports the facilitator directly by asking questions, if the situation requires it.\n\nNote-taker: Documents the meeting\n\nObserves the event from the background\nCaptures all responses. It is helpful to have the question list printed so it can be annotated with notes during the meeting.\nWrites down all important information\nNotes who is talking. Is there an equal participation of all or do some people dominate the process? Do women talk?\n\n\nFocus group participants\n\nCarefully plan who to invite to the focus group meeting. Identifying 10-12 individuals is recommended to ensure the size is manageable, allowing for adequate representation of different perspectives. As much as possible, include representatives from diverse stakeholder groups and community sectors (see examples of types of stakeholders in the section above). When selecting participants, account for their knowledge and roles in the community. Inviting people more knowledgeable about the fisheries and the community, such as a full-time fisher rather than an occasional recreational fisher, will provide more robust and accurate information. Identifying and inviting people who are well-respected in the community helps build trust.\n\nDiscussion logistics and methodology\n\nData can be captured in the “Community Profiling Survey” Kobo form. However, it may be easier for the note-taker to capture the data via written notes in order to more easily capture nuances and information that arise from the group discussion, such as differing answers per respondent. If the information is collected by taking notes. After the focus group meeting has been completed, the responses should be entered into the “Community Profiling Survey” Kobo form. \nEncourage all members of the group to speak as they represent a mixture of ages and social standings that may have different experiences of the fishery.\nPosing questions one by one to the group and waiting for volunteers to respond is one approach to leading a discussion. However, varying how the facilitator solicits responses can help keep the discussion interesting and also ensure that all voices are heard and less vocal participants are able to participate. Prior to beginning the focus group, think through how you would like to elicit responses for each planned question.\n\nOpen forum – Anyone can respond to the question and speak.\nCall on specific participants – This can help ensure that less vocal participants are given a chance to speak. This can be used later in the discussion once the facilitator has a sense of which participants may benefit from being called on. Alternatively, a facilitator may use this technique when they know a certain participant has important knowledge or information related to a question.\nQuick response – Go in a circle and each person very briefly shares their opinion/response to the question. This can be effective in polling the audience as it involves everyone. However, be sure to clearly communicate and enforce time limits or this method can end up draining too much discussion time.\nVote – Poll the audience by asking a question and having people raise their hand in accordance with different response options. This can be done openly or anonymously with eyes closed or with people writing their responses on folded pieces of paper that are then collected.\nGroups – Split the group into smaller groups who discuss and report back to the main group. This technique is especially helpful with large groups when there is not enough time for all group members to participate in the full group forum. In this situation, make sure that each group has stakeholders representing different opinions and perspectives.\n\n\n\nFocus Group Questions\nBegin the focus group by introducing yourself, the project, and the goal of the meeting. Then, have everyone in the room introduce themselves. Plan the best methods for each question to elicit and collect responses beforehand (see section above for ideas). Please see the Community Profiling Survey document for the full list of focus group questions to walk through.\n\n\nFacilitation Resources\n\nFacilitator Core Competencies – International Association of Facilitators (IAF)\nFacilitator’s Meeting Checklist – Social Transformation Project, Tools for Transformation\nIntroduction to Planning and Facilitating Effective Meetings – Social Science Tools for Social Programs, NOAA Coastal Services Center\nGroup Facilitation and Problem-Solving – Community Tool Box, Center for Community Health and Development at the University of Kansas\n\nSection 1:Conducting Effective Meetings\nSection 2:Developing Facilitation Skills\nSection 3:Capturing What People Say: Tips for Recording a Meeting\nSection 4:Techniques for Leading Group Discussions",

    "text": "The quick guide provides step-by-step guidance to collect and validate fisheries and community data through the system developed by Barefoot Ocean. This guidance summarizes the data collection process and outlines the protocols for updating reference files and quality control tables. A full guide with further details on the Fisheries Data Collection system can be found in the Training Materials folder linked below.\nWe developed four survey forms to collect data on fisheries landings and fishing communities. Detailed survey descriptions are available in the full guide in English, Bahasa Indonesian, Cebuano, French, Tagalog, Swahili, Malagasy, Spanish, Portuguese, and Tetun translations here.\nThe Landings Monitoring Survey captures the minimum data, ideally daily or as often as possible, needed to track long-term trends in fisheries production, species composition, and catch value. This survey can help evaluate the effects of fisheries closures or other management strategies by comparing data before and after implementation. The survey is short and user-friendly to allow for more frequent and consistent data collection.\nThe Landings Profiling Survey collects detailed fisheries data on gear, effort, and size of individual fish or invertebrates alongside specialized information for specific species groups such as sex, catch quality, stylet data, and egg maturity. Catch quality of octopus includes storage methods, color, tentacle number, physical abrasions, beak quality, and skin conditions. Octopus stylet data includes sample photos and growth circumference. Egg maturity data accounts for gonad weight, color, stage, length, and line appearances in the ovary glands of female octopuses. These data complement the landings monitoring data and help partners better understand observed catch trends in fisheries production and the effects of fisheries management. The survey was designed to be performed at the beginning of involvement in a community and subsequently conducted every one to two years, before and after implementing the management strategy, or as needed to explain changes in catch observed through monitoring data.\nThe Community Profiling Survey gathers a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic and fisheries landscape of a community. The survey is used when first engaging with a community and repeated when appropriate to document major shifts in fishing behavior, fisher perceptions, and resource management. Survey frequency will depend on project scope (i.e., when a change is expected to occur) or\nThe Fisher Household Survey captures detailed fisher household information, such as household-level perceptions of fishing-related activities, income sources, daily activities, main fish species caught, reliance on fish for food, and fishing activity. The survey is used when first engaging with a community and repeated every two to five years or after management interventions to document shifts in fishing behavior, fisher perceptions, management effectiveness, food security, trust, and gender equity.\nSteps for Using KoboToolbox Forms\n\nPrepare reference data\n\nReference data can be updated via Smartsheet and contains comprehensive information on the administrative levels of the fishing communities (country, province, district/municipality, village/community), landing sites, fishers, buyers, data collectors, species data, management areas, habitat types, gear types, and partnering organizations.\nReference data sheets are used to populate dropdown lists in the KoboToolBox survey forms and join additional data needed for analysis such as village coordinates and fisher gender.\nUpdate reference data with new species, fishers, buyers, landing sites, villages, etc. that are needed for data collection in new areas. Specific, step-by-step instructions for how to update reference files in Smartsheet can be found here.\nWhen adding a new entry, BFO automatically receives notification, so there is no need to comment to let us know you’ve added new data. Please do let us know, however, if an existing entry changes by commenting and describing the change.\nIt is critical that these files are up to date in order for data collection and analysis to run smoothly. Reference files are uploaded to kobo everyday at 9am EST.\n\nSet up the KoboToolbox Account\n\nAll surveys are administered through the use of a KoboToolBox form. Each of the survey forms can be shared with a KoboToolBox account. Set up your KoboToolbox Account here on the general server. Please reach out to courtney@barefootocean.org with account details and the forms will be shared with your account.\n\nDownload the KoboCollect App.\n\nThe Kobo forms can be accessed through the KoboCollect free Android mobile phone app or via Enketo web form.\n\nLoad forms in KoboCollect App (detailed instructions found here).\n\nOnce the app is downloaded, set up the server URL, Username, and Password, which connects your KoboCollect app to the KoboToolbox server. This allows you to download deployed forms from KoboToolbox to your mobile device and also send data collected through the app back to the server. For the URL, use the general use server URL - https://kc.kobotoolbox.org. You can access “Project Settings” by clicking the icon in the top right hand corner of the home screen. On the home screen, select “Download Form.” A list of all your deployed survey forms should appear. Press “Select All” to have all the survey forms sent to the app or select the ones you wish to have by selecting them manually. Then, click “Get Selected.” It is important that the surveys are regularly updated to ensure the latest version of the form is being used so as to not cause issues in the data pipeline down the line. While the webform is automatically updated when a new version of the survey is available, users must configure “auto-update” in the app. You can set up auto-update by going to “Settings” and “Form management”. Additional information on automatically updating surveys in the app can be found here.\n\nCollect data with the KoboToolBox survey forms\n\nCollect data by selecting “Start New Form” in the KoboCollect app. See detailed instructions on collecting data using the app here. At the end of the survey, select “Finalize.” If you want to edit the form before submitting, select “Save as draft.” If you selected “Save as draft,” your form will be sent to “Drafts.” Here, you can make edits to forms before you submit them to the final dataset. After you make changes, select “Finalize,” as mentioned above. After selecting “Finalize,” the form is automatically stored under “Ready to send.” In the current version of Kobo, you can still edit forms here. In the future, however, you will not be able to edit once they are finalized, and “Ready to send” will just be a holding place to store finalized forms until you have an internet connection to send them to the server. Select “Send selected” to send all forms to the server. Data collected using the app or web form will be cleaned and stored in a central data storage system. Raw data is backed up in the KoboToolbox database.\n\nValidate data in Smartsheet\n\nAll data that flows through the fisheries data system is validated in Smartsheet. A full step-by-step instruction guide for completing data validation can be found here.\nData is sent for validation under two scenarios; 1) new names for a fisher, buyer, data collector or species are manually added in Kobo Collect, or 2) a numeric value falls beyond established thresholds. These entries must be verified before being included in the final dataset, visualized in the dashboard, and added to the reference files.\nAny new names or flagged data are sent to the relevant quality control (QA) table in Smartsheet for field teams to validate. The quality control tables are partner-specific and can be accessed via update requests sent to your email or by visiting the Dynamic View links provided to you. Field team leads will be notified via email when data needs to be validated in the QA tables.\nValidating new names: When a new name is entered during data collection, these entries are automatically cross-referenced against the reference files to assess whether new entries might already exist in the reference files, but perhaps spelled differently. Any similar existing entries will be added to the QA table under the “ref_match” columns. Team leads can then easily verify if the “new” data is in fact already in the reference files. Team leads will complete the “validation_options” column in each QA table by selecting either new_datae, the cross-referenced data entry from the reference file (i.e. a “ref_match”), other, or remove. If “other” is selected, you must provide a name in the “other” column. If it’s a new local species name that needs to be validated, a column with the photo taken during data collection will be provided for reference.\nValidating numeric values with threshold warnings: For any flagged data entries, team leads will complete data validation in the “correct” column by selecting Y (yes, values are correct), N (no, values are not correct), or remove (data cannot be validated and should be removed from the master dataset). If no is selected, correct values for the numerator or denominator should be entered in the “correct_numerator” and “correct_denominator” columns.\nOnce the data have been verified in the QA tables, we will append new information to the reference file and provide necessary corrections to the master dataset.\n\nUpdate translations sheet\n\nTranslations for all languages are completed by editing the translations Google Sheet. If you find that a translation needs updating, please directly update the Google Sheet, highlight the updated row in yellow, and add a comment assigning the task by typing “@” or “+” followed by the email addresses alice@barefootocean.org and brittany@barefootocean.org. If new translations are needed, the Barefoot team will comment and assign the task to the country team lead.\n\nVisualize and use data\n\nAutomated analyses and visualizations will be available through standardized dashboards. Datasets will also be available through download or direct link to another database or data warehouse.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\nThank you!\nBarefoot Ocean Team\nBarefoot Ocean Contacts\nCourtney - courtney@barefootocean.org\nBrittany - brittany@barefootocean.org\nKatie- katie@barefootocean.org\nLaura- laura@barefootocean.org",

Field team leads will be notified via email when data needs to be validated in the QA tables.\nValidating new names: When a new name is entered during data collection, these entries are automatically cross-referenced against the reference files to assess whether new entries might already exist in the reference files, but perhaps spelled differently. Any similar existing entries will be added to the QA table under the “ref_match” columns. Team leads can then easily verify if the “new” data is in fact already in the reference files. Team leads will complete the “validation_options” column in each QA table by selecting either new_datae, the cross-referenced data entry from the reference file (i.e. a “ref_match”), other, or remove. If “other” is selected, you must provide a name in the “other” column. If it’s a new local species name that needs to be validated, a column with the photo taken during data collection will be provided for reference.\nValidating numeric values with threshold warnings: For any flagged data entries, team leads will complete data validation in the “correct” column by selecting Y (yes, values are correct), N (no, values are not correct), or remove (data cannot be validated and should be removed from the master dataset). If no is selected, correct values for the numerator or denominator should be entered in the “correct_numerator” and “correct_denominator” columns.\nOnce the data have been verified in the QA tables, we will append new information to the reference file and provide necessary corrections to the master dataset.\n\nUpdate translations sheet\n\nTranslations for all languages are completed by editing the translations Google Sheet. If you find that a translation needs updating, please directly update the Google Sheet, highlight the updated row in yellow, and add a comment assigning the task by typing “@” or “+” followed by the email addresses alice@barefootocean.org and brittany@barefootocean.org. If new translations are needed, the Barefoot team will comment and assign the task to the country team lead.\n\nVisualize and use data\n\nAutomated analyses and visualizations will be available through standardized dashboards. Datasets will also be available through download or direct link to another database or data warehouse.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\nThank you!\nBarefoot Ocean Team\nBarefoot Ocean Contacts\nCourtney - courtney@barefootocean.org\nBrittany - brittany@barefootocean.org\nKatie- katie@barefootocean.org\nLaura- laura@barefootocean.org",

    "text": "All data that flows through the fisheries data system is validated in Smartsheet. Data is sent for validation under two scenarios; 1) new names are manually added in Kobo Collect, or 2) a numeric value falls beyond established thresholds. Once data is validated, both the master datasets in the database and the reference tables are updated. Reference tables serve as inputs for dropdown lists in KoboToolbox forms and contain data that is added to the master datasets through joins. See the decision tree below (Figure 1).\nData triggered for validation is sent to one of three tables: 1) Landings Name QA, 2) Species QA, or 3) Value Warnings QA. The instructions below detail the data validation process in Smartsheet for the three validation tables. Each validation table will require either selecting the correct field value from a dropdown list or entering correct values manually. The process will be appended for future data validation needs, as required.\nStep 1: Provide Barefoot Ocean with point of contact email addresses for those responsible for data validation.\n\nThe organization managing multiple partners may provide all points of contact information.\nIndividual partners may provide point of contact information.\nThe points of contact will receive data validation notifications through email.\n\nStep 2: Check your email for a data validation request.\n\nYou will receive an email from “Smartsheet Automation” (Figure 2)\nThe email will contain a message with links to proceed with validation through either a “Dynamic View” or “Open Request”. Dynamic View is a table format and Open Request will direct you to a validation form.\nTo open with “Dynamic View” (Step 3, Option A), click the link that begins with “https://dynamicview.smarthseet.com….”\nTo open the update request form (Step 3, Option B), click the blue “Open request” button\nA preview of the entries that need to be validated will appear below this message, but you will not be able to validate any data directly in the email\nAt the bottom of the email, there is a link for “Go to the sheet”; however, the underlying sheet has restricted access. Please review your data validation via Dynamic view, Open request, or your partner-specific report (coming soon).\n\nFigure 1: Data validation decision tree.\n\nFigure 2: Sample Smartsheet Validation Email Message\n\nStep 3, Option A: Complete your data validation via Dynamic View (recommended)\n\nFor this option, you will need to create a free Smartsheet account. You will be directed from the email to set up an account.\nClick on the Dynamic View link in the email request.\nA new internet browser window will open with a table-like setup for all entries. Here, you can easily scroll through all the entries that need validation.\nClick on a row to begin validation.\nA “Details” panel will appear on the right.\nReview the context fields and populate the validation fields. The validation fields contain the data that will be transferred to the final dataset (Table 1).\nLeave a comment, ONLY IF there is something that needs our attention. Barefoot Ocean staff will review comments and respond appropriately.\nClick the blue “Save” button to save your selection.\nOnce validated, that row will disappear from your dynamic view.\nClick on the next row and repeat steps to complete validation for all entries.\nYou can exit and re-enter by clicking on the dynamic view link from your email or logging into your account at any time. You do not need to validate all entries in one sitting.\nYou can bookmark this link and return at any time.\n\nTable 1: Primary fields in the validation tables. Context fields provide information needed to validate data. Validation fields are populated with data that will be transferred to the master datasets. Only the validation field can be edited.

Entries in which no option was selected in ’validation_options” will not be included.\nThis email may contain a link to a sheet name “Landings Name QA”; however, access to this sheet is locked.\nTo see any remaining validation needed, you will need to wait for the next update request email or open the Dynamic View.\n\nFigure 5: Example of “Open Request” format\n\nFrequently Asked Questions: 1. Can multiple people work on data validation at the same time? - Yes, however, once an entry (row) has been validated in Dynamic View it will no longer be visible.\n\nDo I need a Smartsheet account?\n\n\nOnly to complete data validation via Dynamic View (i.e. the table view). You do not need a paid account, with a free trial or free version (once your trial is completed), you will be able to view and interact with all the Smartsheet files owned by Barefoot Ocean.\n\n\nWhat happens after data is validated?\n\n\nIn some cases, data will undergo additional review by the Barefoot Ocean data team. Validated data will be updated in the database, and when appropriate, dropdown menus will be updated in the Kobo reference files and forms (Figure 6). Data that has not been validated will not appear in the dashboard visualizations or statistics, but will be available in the raw data download.\n\nIf at any time you encounter any errors, have questions, or need support for completing the data validation, please contact us at barefootinfo@barefootocean.org.\nFigure 6: Data Validation to Reference File Workflow",
