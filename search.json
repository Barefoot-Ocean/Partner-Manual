Also see Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s A Quarto tip a day.\nEach page of our site has a similar first few lines - this YAML, like we saw in our _quarto.yml and it is indicated by two sets of 3 dashes --- :\n---\ntitle: My title\n---\nYou’re able to add more features to individual pages by including it in the YAML, which for the most part here only includes a title.

    "text": "Update _quarto.yml\nLet’s have a closer look at the _quarto.yml file.\nThis type of file (.yml or .yaml) is written in YAML (“Yet Another Markup Language”). You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.",

This takes about 20 minutes. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see Allison Horst’s ESM 206 Google Doc).\n\n\nClone your repo\nYou’ll start by cloning your repository into RStudio.\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git &gt; paste your repository name.\nR for Excel Users: Clone your repository using RStudio has detailed instructions and screenshots of these steps.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nNext, you’ll install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won’t see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio (as well as all other applications on your computer, including the command line).\n\n\nRStudio orientation\nNow let’s take a moment to get oriented. This is an RStudio project, which is indicated in the top-right. The bottom right pane shows all the files in your project; everything we’ve cloned from GitHub. We can open any RStudio project by opening its .Rproj file, or from RStudio File &gt; Open Project ….\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the project name and files pane\n\n\n\n\nVisual Editor\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\nHere’s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have some content formatted in a Google Doc? You can copy-paste it into the Visual Editor and most formatting will be retained.\nThe editing bar provides familiar point and click access to text formatting options like bulleted or numbered lists.\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the point and click editing bar\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe Visual Editor also lets you use many keyboard shortcuts that might be familiar for adding boldface (command-b), italics (command-i), or headers. On a Mac, option-command-2 will make a level 2 header. Try it with option-command-1, or option-command-0 for normal text!\n\n\nInsert an image or figure\nTo insert an image (called a figure in Quarto), click the image icon. This brings up a window in which we can select the image, set its alignment, give it a caption and alt text, hyperlink it, or edit other metadata.\n\n\n\nInsert image or figure using the Visual Editor\n\n\nOnce an image is added, clicking on that image gives us editing options. We can resize it dynamically by clicking in the image and dragging a corner or side to resize. When an image is selected, its dimensions are displayed for editing. Clicking on the gray ellipsis to the right of the dimensions opens the pop-up window to access more metadata edits.\n\n\nInsert a table\nSimilar to adding an image, to insert a table, we click the Table dropdown.",

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.",
